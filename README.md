# secim-poll-website
This is really super basic poll website for the next presidental election in Turkey.


I have zero knowledge of HTML and I wanted to create a poll website. 
I worked on it approximately 5 hours in total.
I believe it has a lot of errors.However, it is not even what i wanted to create.
Later, I will work on it in a more detailed way.

I used pollcode api and modified it.

I don't even know how to use api i just tried it.
It needs some javascript and maybe another poll api.
